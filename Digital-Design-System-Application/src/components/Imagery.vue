                    <p>The imagery selected for our materials and communications should differentiate us from other healthcare companies. Choose images that support our brand strength, identity, and stability. Our imagery guidelines are designed to encourage
                        correct selection of images for all Blue Cross NC affiliated materials. Follow the principles listed below and the three image type requirements when choosing images for your communications.</p>

                        Image Selection
                    </p>
                    <p>Our imagery has three categories:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Lifestyle</li>
                            <li>Health and Recovery</li>
                            <li>Metaphoric</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <p>Our imagery is engaging and distinctive yet maintains a common style. Always keep the following principles in mind while selecting or shooting imagery:</p>

                    <v-expansion-panels accordion class="pt-2">
                        <v-expansion-panel v-for="(item,i) in 1" :key="i">

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Honest and believable; never artificial, manipulated, overly posed or stylized.</li>
                                    <li>Tone is slightly desaturated with a bit of contrast between the foreground and background.</li>
                                    <li>Lighting should come from existing sources whenever possible. Back light effects, color burns and light leaks should occur naturally and not be overly sought after or staged.</li>
                                    <li>Aim for a realistic style rather than one that is distorted or exaggerated.</li>
                                    <li>People appear candid and sincere. People engaged in activities appear to be acting spontaneously, unaware of the camera. Show activities that evoke feelings of aspiration and are honest and believable life moments.</li>
                                    <li>Interiors and outdoor environments are shot true to life. They are shown as they normally appear, not obviously staged or dressed.</li>

                    <p>Metaphoric imagery allows for visual communications that are far less literal than our other imagery and creates restful breaks that allow deeper reflection. It suggests ideas and metaphors that engage the audience on an intellectual
